      Egyptian hieroglyphs, were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt
      for writing the Egyptian language. Hieroglyphs combined logographic,
      syllabic and alphabetic elements, with more than 100 distinct characters.

<h1>੭* ‧₊° The rosing of Hieroglyphs ೀ.ᐟ⭒๋࣭ ⭑</h1>
<h2>
  The use of hieroglyphic writing arose from proto-literate symbol systems in
  the Early Bronze Age, around the 32nd century BC (Naqada III), with the first
  decipherable sentence written in the Egyptian language dating to the Second
  Dynasty (28th century BC) Cursive hieroglyphs were used for religious
  literature on papyrus and wood. The later hieratic and demotic Egyptian
  scripts were derived from hieroglyphic writing, as was the Proto-Sinaitic
  script that later evolved into the Phoenician alphabet.

<h1> ⍣ ೋ Etymology 𝜗ৎ</h1>

<h2>The word hieroglyph comes from the Greek adjective ἱερογλυφικός (hieroglyphikos),a compound of ἱερός (hierós 'sacred') and γλύφω (glýphō '(Ι) carve, engrave'; see glyph) meaning sacred carving.

The glyphs themselves, since the Ptolemaic period, were called τὰ ἱερογλυφικὰ [γράμματα] (tà hieroglyphikà [grámmata]) "the sacred engraved letters", the Greek counterpart to the Egyptian expression of mdw.w-nṯr "god's words".Greek ἱερόγλυφος meant "a carver of hieroglyphs".</h2>

   <h2> Demotic (from Ancient Greek: δημοτικός dēmotikós, 'popular') is the ancient Egyptian script derived from northern forms of hieratic used in the Nile Delta. The term was first used by the Greek historian Herodotus to distinguish it from hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts. By convention, the word "Demotic" is capitalized in order to distinguish it from demotic Greek.</h2>
    <h1>ੈ✩‧₊˚ The Early Demotics in Egyptian History ༊*·˚</h1>
   <h2> Early Demotic (often referred to by the German term Frühdemotisch) developed in Lower Egypt during the later part of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, particularly found on steles from the Serapeum of Saqqara. It is generally dated between 650 and 400 BC, as most texts written in Early Demotic are dated to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty and the subsequent rule as a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire, which was known as the Twenty-seventh Dynasty. After the reunification of Egypt under Psamtik I, Demotic replaced Abnormal Hieratic in Upper Egypt, particularly during the reign of Amasis II, when it became the official administrative and legal script. During this period, Demotic was used only for administrative, legal, and commercial texts, while hieroglyphs and hieratic were reserved for religious texts and literature.</h2>

   <h2> Middle Demotic </h2>
Middle Demotic (c. 400–30 BC) is the stage of writing used during the Ptolemaic Kingdom. From the 4th century BC onward, Demotic held a higher status, as may be seen from its increasing use for literary and religious texts. By the end of the 3rd century BC, Koine Greek was more important, as it was the administrative language of the country; Demotic contracts lost most of their legal force unless there was a note in Greek of being registered with the authorities.</h2>
